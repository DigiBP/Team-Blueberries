<!-- Contenct -->
<!-- Introduction -->
<h2 id="1. Introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
This work was completed as part of a group project in the Digitalization of Business Processes module in the spring semester of 2023.
The first step was to analyze and model an existing process. In a second step, the existing process was to be optimized and automated as far as possible.
</br></br>

<h3 id="1.1 Deliverables and Artefacts">1.1 Deliverables and Artefacts</h3>
We following deliverables were mandatory:
<ul>
  <li>Link to GitHub repositories containing modelling artefacts and other project artefacts, if required, and a documentation (e.g., Readme and interlinked .md files).</li>
  <li>Link to a running workflow(s) and/or instatiation(s) of a link to start form(s) and/or cloud-based deployment(s).</li>
  <li>Link to presentation slides.</li>
</ul>
</br>

<h3 id="1.2 Tools and platforms">1.2 Tools and platforms</h3>
We had several DevOps-tools and development platforms available for our assessment.
We used the following:
<ul>
  <li>Camunda Modeler (Platform 7)</li>
  <li>GitHub</li>
  <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
  <li>Git</li>
  <li>Make</li>
  <li>Google</li>
</ul>
</br>

<h3 id="1.3 Languages used">1.3 Languages used</h3>
To fulfill our tasks, we used several languages:
<ul>
  <li>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) & Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</li>
  <li>Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)</li>
  <li>Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL)</li>
  <li>Git commands</li>
</ul>

<!-- Current situation -->
<h2 id="3. Current situation">3. Current situation</h2>
<p>Currently, when an employee wants to request a leave of absence, the process is time-consuming and almost entirely paper-based. The employee must first ask the secretary to print out a form that he can fill out and send to his manager. The manager can then validate the request, but does not have the possibility to consult the balance of available days or the attendance schedule of all employees in his team. If the manager refuses the request, he announces it to the employee, otherwise the request is forwarded to the HR team. The HR manager must also sign the form before passing it to an HR secretary. The HR secretary then verifies the presence of both signatures as well as the employee's available day balance (in the ERP). If everything is in order, the request is officially accepted.</p>
</br>

<h3 id="3.1 As-Is Business Process">3.1 As-Is Business Process</h3>
<p>The As-Is Business Process looks like this:</p>

<h3 id="3.2 Pain Points">3.2 ‚ö°Pain Points‚ö°</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Time-consuming and cascading process (several people involved).</li>
  <li>Paper-based process, not digitized.</li>
  <li>The manager does not have the possibility to consult the planning of his team.</li>
  <li>The manager does not have the possibility to consult the balance of available days of his employees.</li>
</ul>
</br></br>

<!-- Desired situation -->
<h2 id="4. Desired situation">4. Desired situation</h2>
<p>&#129488;// Please have a review @Charline. In the meantime, there have probably been some changes.</p>
<p>Proposed improvement: The implementation of a system that communicates with the ERP. This system is accessible to the HR team and all employees of the company, including managers.</p>

<p>When the employee wants to request a leave of absence, he will be able to log in to the system by fingerprint recognition. He will be able to check the number of vacation days still available, and if his balance is at 0, he will have the possibility to request an unpaid vacation. When the manager receives the request, he will be able to consult the planning of his team before making his choice. Finally, if the request is rejected, the employee will be informed, otherwise the HR team will be informed that a new absence request has been accepted.</p>
</br>

<h3 id="4.1 To-Be Business Process">4.1 To-Be Business Process</h3>
<p>The To-Be Business Process looks like this:</p>
<p>&#129488;// Add pic from our final to-be business process</p>
</br>

<h3 id="4.2 Decision Tables">4.2 Decision Tables</h3>
<p>To keep the modeling process as lean as possible, we used two decision tables (DMN).</p>
<p>In the first DMN it is first checked which type of absence is desired. This can be seen in the first line.</p>
<p>After that, there are a number of additional specifications that must be met in order for the test to be approved either automatically or provisionally. If a requirement is not met, the request is rejected.</p>
<p>The second DMN represents the second step to ensure that the capacity of the team is not reached when an emyployee wants to take time off. The current capacity is set to &lt;50% of employees must be available.</p>
<p>In the following subsections, the DRD models and the corresponding DMN models can be viewed.</p>
</br>

<h4 id="4.2.1 Decision Table Absence from type">4.2.1 Decision Table "Absence from type"</h4>
<p>In the DRD model, the dependencies on the DMN are evident:</p>

</br>

<h3 id="4.3 Improvements">4.3 Improvements</h3>
<p>In the As-Is business process, there were a lot of manual subtasks that had to be paper-based and sent to other departments or processed internally by other people.</p>
<p>In the To-Be Business Process, the overall process is streamlined and simplified, and involves fewer departments and people. The main improvement, however, is digitization and automation, because there are no more paper-based forms and many sub-process steps are now triggered automatically.</p>
</br></br>
<!-- Ending Desired situation -->




<!-- Digitalization and Automation -->
<h2 id="5. Digitalization and Automation">5. Digitalization and Automation</h2>
<p>The first step was to model the As-Is Business Process in the tool "Camunda Modeler". This quickly made it clear which departments or individuals were involved in the overall process at all and were interdependent. This allowed us to discuss how to proceed, what could be automated and what would remain a manual task. Ultimately, it gave us the basis for the To-Be Business Process and the certainty that paper-based forms could be dispensed with for the time being.</p>
<p>In the To-Be Business Process, we defined in a second step which departments or individuals were still needed in the overall process, which dependencies were still there or were new, and how we could possibly streamline the overall process. The results can be found in the previous chapter.</p>
<p>The following subsections show our results, which we have worked out with the Make tool in order to automate the To-Be business process..</p>
</br>

<h3 id="5.1 Make scenario Google Forms process trigger">5.1 Make scenario "Google Forms process trigger"</h3>
<p>The trigger of the overall process is indirectly a Google Form. As soon as the employee fills it out and sends it, the request is saved in a new row of the associated Google Sheet, which ultimately triggers the overall process.</p>
<p>As a second step, we defined a business key that generates a random number and is unique throughout the process. Since there were some problems with variables from the Google Sheet regarding typing, we forced some of them to become strings with the method "toString()", so that they would be recognized as strings later on.</p>
<p>The last step saves the received variables of the Google Sheet and sends them to our BPMN model in Camunda. This way the data can be further used in the following process steps. The following image sets up the make process:</p>
<img src="https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Blueberries/blob/main/docs/Make_01_Google%20Forms%20process%20trigger.png" alt="Google Forms process trigger">
</br>

<h3 id="5.2 Make scenario Inform the employee">5.2 Make scenario "Inform the employee"</h3>
<p>After the first Make scenario was triggered with the main trigger, the entered data went through the first DMN as variables. As described above, the input is checked against predefined rules/criteria and then a decision is made as to whether the request is accepted or rejected automatically or provisionally.</p>
<p>In case of a rejection, which is what the trigger represents, this Make scenario is triggered. Again, since we were struggling with a variable, we forced it to be a string with the method "toString()". Finally, the system automatically sends the employee an email telling him or her that his or her request has been rejected.</p>
<p>The following image sets up the make process:</p>
