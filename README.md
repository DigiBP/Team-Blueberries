<h2 id="1. Current situation">1. Current situation</h2>
Currently, when an employee wants to request a leave of absence, the process is time-consuming and almost entirely paper-based. The employee must first ask the secretary to print out a form that he can fill out and send to his manager. The manager can then validate the request, but does not have the possibility to consult the balance of available days or the attendance schedule of all employees in his team. If the manager refuses the request, he announces it to the employee, otherwise the request is forwarded to the HR team. The HR manager must also sign the form before passing it to an HR secretary. The HR secretary then verifies the presence of both signatures as well as the employee's available day balance (in the ERP). If everything is in order, the request is officially accepted.  

**Identified pain points**: 
- Time-consuming and cascading process (several people involved) 
- Paper-based process, not digitized 
- The manager does not have the possibility to consult the planning of his team 
- The manager does not have the possibility to consult the balance of available days of his employees

Proposed improvement: The implementation of a system that communicates with the ERP. This system is accessible to the HR team and all employees of the company, including managers. 

When the employee wants to request a leave of absence, he will be able to log in to the system by fingerprint recognition. He will be able to check the number of vacation days still available, and if his balance is at 0, he will have the possibility to request an unpaid vacation. When the manager receives the request, he will be able to consult the planning of his team before making his choice. Finally, if the request is rejected, the employee will be informed, otherwise the HR team will be informed that a new absence request has been accepted.
